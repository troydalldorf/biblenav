Meaning if you have accepted Jesus as your Savior then purifying yourself is a current and ongoing effort till you die. Most importantly, it is not your effort (i.e. trying harder) that leads to purification. It is yielding to God so he can work in you to transform you into a full likeness of Jesus. This process is called sanctification. Perfection will not be met until reaching heaven. However, one must constantly pursue this goal. This is one of the “no neutral” phenomena. Either one is growing or decreasing in spiritual purity. Those who do nothing are not neutral. They are slowly drifting towards less purity.]", "topics": ["Child Of God", "Holy", "Pure"], "see": [] },

[NOTE: Baptism is commanded. Typically one is baptized and subsequently or simultaneously  receives the Holy Spirit. However, all possible orders are seen in the Bible. In this passage, Gentiles received the Holy Spirit while Peter was talking. They had not made an oral declaration of receiving Jesus as their personal savior. There are two important points to make: 1) The main concern in Baptism is a changed heart. The change is from being one who rules his or her life, to one who sets Jesus/God/Holy Spirit as Lord of his or her heart. 2) If a true heart change has occurred then one is baptized with the Holy Spirit whether or not water is used (See Luke 23:43 where Jesus informs one of the criminals on the cross next to him “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.” The criminal acknowledged Jesus as Lord and Savior. This is proof of a changed heart. Jesus’ statement proves that the man was accepted as righteous before God. He would be in heaven with Jesus that very day.  There was no baptism with water.

Why would God punish descendants for the sins of previous generations? First, it is important to note that this only applies to those that hate God. Secondly, the passage indicates that the punishment is passed on to future generations. God does not and cannot cause someone to sin. It is against his nature. If God does not cause the sin to continue, why does the punishment? The answer is that often sin tendencies are passed on to the next generation. Children who grow up in the presence of a repetitive ongoing sin often suffer in one of two ways. Either they form the same habits predisposing him or her to the same sin.

God will he known instinctively and his will performed spontaneously (cf. Isa 54:13; John 6:45). Experience of God will be direct, not dependent on external instruction. The knowledge spoken of is not theoretical knowledge transmitted by religious instruction. It is rather knowledge of God based on a heart experience of divine grace and imparted by the Holy Spirit with assurance that the believer has been received into the family of God through the forgiveness of sins (so KD). This knowledge does not militate against or render unnecessary religious instruction. (See the NT teaching concerning teachers in 1 Cor 12:28-29 and Eph 4:11-12.) There will be direct access to God for both Jew and Gentile. A vital feature of the old covenant was human mediation (cf. Exod 20:19). In the new one there is immediate access to God through Christ, our High Priest (cf. Heb 4:16; 10:19-22). The firsthand knowledge of God will be completely fulfilled in the coming kingdom (so Cunliffe-Jones). For the present it does not mean that every believer will he self-sufficient and independent of others. But it does indicate that all will have their own experience of God without resort to others. \"The least of them\" is very broad in meaning and includes \"the least\" in intellectual ability, in influence or position, in moral capacity—all are included in the comprehensive scope of the phrase.

I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. [19] And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years.

God will not honor the rich who are concerned with storing riches up for themselves.  That leads to the person believing they are in total control of their own destiny and to a denial/forgetting that everything we have is a gift from God.  The rich must struggle to keep the balance of knowing that the wealth they have is a gift from God and to manage their wealth as a steward rather than managing it as an owner.  They must also struggle with not being overcome with greed for more wealth.  God requires us to give the first tenth of our wealth to Him to help us keep these balances in perspective.     NOTE 2: This is a negative example of true riches. It tells us that abundance of possessions is not a man’s life.

So the devil holds men as captives with no hope of escape by any means of their own. And Jesus has the great commission to stand forth as a herald and to proclaim to them ἄφεσις, \"release.\" This word is a correlative of captives and is thus used in the sense of release; but it is the standard term of the New Testament for the remission of sins, sending them away forever (compare 1:77).

Only one (Bib. Knowl. Cmy. Noted that Luke uniquely uses the Greek word, dynamis=spiritual ability, on several occasions. There is an interesting implication. If the power was present in this case, it implies there are other situations where the power was missing! There are two passages supporting this point: Matthew 13:58 and Mark 6:5-6. Faith must be present for Jesus to heal, it may be as small as a mustard seed (Matthew 17:20). This does not mean Jesus could not heal unless faith were present. It means Jesus chose not to heal when faith was absent. The Bible does not spell why this is the case. However, when Jesus healed it was meant to confirm that he was God’s son and to bring glory to God. In the absence of faith healing is nothing more than a curiosity, a spectacle, or freak show. This fails to bring honor to God. Hence, Jesus was compelled not to heal in these situations. ].", "topics": ["Jesus Heals When Faith Is Shown"], "see": [] },

Doing so leads to a futile and demoralizing downward spiral to defeat. People cannot defeat sin on their own power. This passage reminds us that through Christ’s death on the cross every Christian is regenerated, righteous, sanctified, and holy by God’s work. All we need to do is believe this and live like it is true. Admittedly, the process of sanctification requires time and the person’s cooperation. However, it is God’s power that makes sanctification possible. Christians must submit (hupotaso – get into their proper rank) and let God work in and through them."], "see": [] },

[NOTE: Each of the categories listed for this passage fits indirectly. The passage is addressing the “enemies of the cross of Christ.” Those enemies can be in or outside the church. It is likely the passage is addressing those in the church. It could be the Judaizers or antinomians. The Judaizers were people who pretended to be Christians but insisted that it was Christ plus the Jewish traditions. The antinomians threw off all restraints as Jesus paid for all sin (i.e. cheap grace). One’s true position with Jesus is always revealed by the fruit. Paul listed their fruit in verse 19. All of it benefited themselves – a key to recognizing a false Gospel. It is odd, on one hand Christians are to call out sin that is clear. This prevents the Church from slowly sliding down the slippery slope into sin. However, on the other hand, when sin is not clear or easily documented, Christians are told to wait for God to separate out the false Christians in the end (Parable of the wheat and weeds-Matthew 13:23-29).]", "topics": ["False Christians (Believers)", "Guard Yourself", "Revenge Is God’s Alone", "Riches, False", "Sin Has Consequences", "Sin Leads To Destruction", "Sin-Characteristics Of", "Sin Should Appall Christians", "Thinking, Bad-Not Like God"], "see": [] },
